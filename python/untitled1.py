Reduced matrices actually represent the users and items individually. 
The m rows in the first matrix represent the m users, and the 
p columns tell you about the features or characteristics of 
the users. The same goes for the item matrix with n items and 
p characteristics. The two columns in the user matrix and the 
two rows in the item matrix are called latent factors and are 
an indication of hidden characteristics about the users or 
the items.
Note: Overfitting happens when the model trains to fit the 
training data so well that it doesnâ€™t perform well with new 
data.
One of the popular algorithms to factorize a matrix is the 
singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm. SVD came into 
the limelight when matrix factorization was seen performing 
well in the Netflix prize competition. Other algorithms 
include PCA and its variations, NMF, and so on. Autoencoders 
can also be used for dimensionality reduction in case you 
want to use Neural Networks.
Note: Surprise is a Python SciKit that comes with various 
recommender algorithms and similarity metrics to make it easy 
to build and analyze recommenders.

Defaultdict is a container like dictionaries present in the 
module collections. Defaultdict is a sub-class of the 
dictionary class that returns a dictionary-like object. 
The functionality of both dictionaries and defaultdict are 
almost same except for the fact that defaultdict never raises 
a KeyError. It provides a default value for the key that does 
not exists.
